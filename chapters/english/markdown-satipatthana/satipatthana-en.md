# The Foundations of Mindfulness (English)

## Introduction

Thus have I heard.

On one occasion the Blessed One was in the Kuru country where there was a town
of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus.” “Bhante,” the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed
One said this:

“Bhikkhus, this is the one-way path for the purification of beings, for the
surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and
dejection, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbāna,
namely, the four foundations of mindfulness. What are the four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent,
clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in
regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, ardent,
clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in
regard to the world. He dwells contemplating mind in mind, ardent, clearly
comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to
the world. He dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly
comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to
the world.

## Contemplation of the Body

### Mindfulness of Breathing

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating
the body in the body?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an
empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, straightened his body,
and established mindfulness in front of him.

Just mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.

Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’;

or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’

Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’;

or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’

He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body’;

he trains thus:‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole body.’

He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in tranquilising the bodily formation’;

he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out tranquilising the bodily formation.’

Just as, bhikkhus, a skilled lathe-worker or his apprentice,

when making a long turn, understands: ‘I make a long turn’;

or, when making a short turn, understands: ‘I make a short turn’;

so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu

breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’;

or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’

Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’;

or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’

He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body’;

he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole body.’

He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in tranquilising the bodily formation’;

he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out tranquilising the bodily formation.’

In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally, or he
dwells contemplating the body in the body externally, or he dwells contemplating
the body in the body both internally and externally. Or else he dwells
contemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he dwells contemplating in
the body its nature of vanishing, or he dwells contemplating in the body its
nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else mindfulness that ‘there is a body’
is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and
repeated mindfulness.

And he dwells independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body.

**[ The section on Mindfulness of Breathing is finished. ]**

### The Four Postures

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu when walking, understands: ‘I am walking’; when
standing, he understands: ‘I am standing’; when sitting, he understands: ‘I am
sitting’; when lying down, he understands: ‘I am lying down’; or however his
body is disposed, he understands it accordingly.

In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally, or he
dwells contemplating the body in the body externally, or he dwells contemplating
the body in the body both internally and externally. Or else he dwells
contemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he dwells contemplating in
the body its nature of vanishing, or he dwells contemplating in the body its
nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else mindfulness that ‘there is a body’
is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and
repeated mindfulness.

And he dwells independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body.

**[ The section on the Four Postures is finished. ]**

### Clear Comprehension

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts with clear comprehension when going
forward and returning, who acts with clear comprehension when looking ahead and
looking away; who acts with clear comprehension when bending and stretching his
limbs; who acts with clear comprehension when wearing his robes and carrying his
outer robe and bowl; who acts with clear comprehension when eating, drinking,
chewing, and tasting; who acts with clear comprehension when defecating and
urinating; who acts with clear comprehension when walking, standing, sitting,
falling asleep, waking up, talking and keeping silent.

In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally, or he
dwells contemplating the body in the body externally, or he dwells contemplating
the body in the body both internally and externally. Or else he dwells
contemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he dwells contemplating in
the body its nature of vanishing, or he dwells contemplating in the body its
nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else mindfulness that ‘there is a body’
is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and
repeated mindfulness.

And he dwells independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body.

**[ The section on Clear Comprehension is finished. ]**

### Unattractiveness of the Body

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet
and down from the top of the hair, bounded by skin, as full of many kinds of
impurity thus:

‘In this body there are head-hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,
sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs,
intestines, mesentery, stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat,
tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine.’

Just as though, bhikkhus, there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of
many sorts of grain, such as hill rice, red rice, beans, peas, millet, and white
rice, and a man with good eyes were to open it and review it thus:

‘This is hill rice, this is red rice, these are beans, these are peas, this is
millet, this is white rice’; so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body
up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair, bounded by
skin, as full of many kinds of impurity thus:

'In this body there are head-hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,
sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs,
intestines, mesentery, stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat,
tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine.'

In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally, or he
dwells contemplating the body in the body externally, or he dwells contemplating
the body in the body both internally and externally. Or else he dwells
contemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he dwells contemplating in
the body its nature of vanishing, or he dwells contemplating in the body its
nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else mindfulness that ‘there is a body’
is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and
repeated mindfulness.

And he dwells independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body.

**[ The section on Unattractiveness of the Body is finished. ]**

### Elements

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body, however it is placed, however
disposed, as consisting of elements thus: 'In this body there are the earth
element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.'

Just as though, bhikkhus, a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow
and were seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces; so too, bhikkhus,
a bhikkhu reviews this same body, however it is placed, however disposed, as
consisting of elements thus: 'In this body there are the earth element, the
water element, the fire element, and the air element.'

In this way he dwells contemplating the body in the body internally, or he
dwells contemplating the body in the body externally, or he dwells contemplating
the body in the body both internally and externally. Or else he dwells
contemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he dwells contemplating in
the body its nature of vanishing, or he dwells contemplating in the body its
nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else mindfulness that ‘there is a body’
is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and
repeated mindfulness.

And he dwells independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body.

**[ The section on Elements is finished. ]**

### Nine Charnel Ground Contemplations

[1] Again, bhikkhus, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel
ground, one, two, or three days dead, bloated, livid, and oozing matter, a
bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus: 'This body too is of the same

[3] Again, bhikkhus, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a
charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews ...

[4] a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews ...

[5] a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together with sinews ...

[6] disconnected bones not held together with sinews scattered in all directions
– here a hand-bone, there a foot bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone,
here a hip-bone, there a back-bone, here a rib-bone, there a chest-bone, here an
arm-bone, there a shoulder-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a
tooth-bone, there the skull – a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus:

[7] Again, bhikkhus, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel
ground, bones bleached white, the colour of shells ...

[8] bones heaped up, more than a year old ...

[9] bones rotted and crumbled to dust, a bhikkhu compares this same
body with it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it will be like that,
it is not exempt from that fate.’

### The Truths

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena in terms
of the Four Noble Truths.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating phenomena in phenomena in
terms of the Four Noble Truths?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: 'This is suffering. The
is the origin of suffering. This is the cessation of suffering. This is the way
leading to the cessation of suffering.'

### Suffering

And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering; ageing
is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair
are suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what
is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the
five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.

And what, bhikkhus, is birth? The birth of beings into the vaious orders of
beings, their coming to birth, precipitation [in a womb], generation, the
manifestation of the aggregates, obtaining the bases for contact – this is
called birth.

And what, bhikkhus, is ageing? The ageing of beings in the various orders of
beings, their old age, brokenness of teeth, greyness of hair, wrinkling of skin,
deline of life, weakness of faculties – this is called ageing.

And what, bhikkhus, is death? The passing of beings out of the various orders of
beings, their passing away, dissolution, disappearance, dying, death, completion
of time, dissolution of aggregates, laying down of the body, the cutting off of
the life faculty – this is called death.

And what, bhikkhus, is sorrow? Bhikkhus, for one who has encountered some
misfortune or is affected by some painful state, there is sorrow, sorrowing,
sorrowfulness, inner sorrow, inner sorriness – this is called sorrow.

And what, bhikkhus, is lamentation? Bhikkhus, for one who has encountered some
misfortune or is affected by some painful state, there is wail and lament,
wailing and lamenting, bewailing and lamentation – this is called lamentation.

And what, bhikkhus, is pain? That, bhikkhus, which is bodily pain, bodily
discomfort, painful, uncomfortable feeling born of bodily contact – this is
called pain.

And what, bhikkhus, is grief? That, bhikkhus, which is mental pain, mental
discomfort, painful, uncomfortable feeling born of mental contact – this is
called grief.

And what, bhikkhus, is despair? Bhikkhus, for one who has encountered some
misfortune or is affected by some painful state, there is the trouble and
despair, the tribulation and desperation – this is called despair.

And what, bhikkhus, is 'union with what is displeasing is suffering'? Here,
bhikkhus, for one who has undesireable, unlovely, disagreeable forms, sounds,
ordours, tastes, and tactile objects;
or for one who has those who do not desire his welfare, his benefit, his
comfort, and his security – (and then) having meetings, assembly, connection,
and mixing with them: this, bhikkhus, is called 'union with what is displeasing
is suffering'.

And what, bhikkhus, is 'separation from what is pleasing is suffering'? Here,
bhikkhus, for one who has desirable, lovely, agreeable forms, sounds, ordours,
tastes, and tactile objects; or, for one who has those who do desire his
welfare, his benefit, his comfort and his security – mothers, fathers,
brothers, or sisters; friends, companions, or blood relatives – (and then) not
having meetings, assembly, connection, and mixing with them: this, bhikkhus, is
called 'separation from what is pleasing is suffering'?

And what, bhikkhus, is 'not to get what one wants is suffeing'? To beings
subject to birth there comes the wish: 'Oh, that we were not subject to birth!
That birth would not come to us!' But this is not to be obtained by wishing;
this is 'not to get what one wants is suffering.'

To beings subject to ageing there comes the wish: 'Oh, that we were not subject
to ageing! That ageing would not come to us!' But this is not to be obtained by
wishing; this is 'not to get what one wants is suffering.'

To beings subject to sickness there comes the wish: 'Oh, that we were not
subject to sickness! That sickness would not come to us!' But this is not to be
obtained by wishing; this is 'not to get what one wants is suffering.'

To beings subject to death there comes the wish: 'Oh, that we were not subject
to death! That death would not come to us!' But this is not to be obtained by
wishing; this is 'not to get what one wants is suffering.'

To beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, there comes
the wish: 'Oh, that we were not subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair! That sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair would not come to
us!' But this is not to be obtained by wishing; this is 'not to get what one
wants is suffering.'

And what, bhikkhus, are the five aggregates subject to clinging that, in brief,
are suffering? They are: the material form aggregate subject to clinging, the
feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to
clinging, the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, the
consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. These are the five aggregates
subject to clinging that, in brief, are suffering.

This, bhikkhus, is called the noble truth of suffering.

### Origin

And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? It is this
craving, which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust,
seeking delight in this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures,
craving for existence, and craving for non-existence.

Now where, bhikkhus, does that craving when it is arising arise? When settling
where does it settle? That in the world which is pleasant and agreeable – here
this craving when it is arising arises, here when settling it settles.

### Cessation

And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? It is the
remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and
relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it.

Now where, bhikkhus, is that craving when it is being abandoned, abandoned? When
ceasing where does it cease? That in the world which is pleasant and agreeable

### The Way

And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is right view, right intention,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
right concentration.

And what, bhikkhus, is right view? Bhikkhus, the knowledge of suffering,
knowledge of the origin of suffering, knowledge of the cessation of suffering,
knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: this, bhikkhus, is
called right view.

And what, bhikkhus, is right intention? Intention of renunciation, intention of
non-ill will, intention of harmlessness: this, bhikkhus, is called right
intention.

And what, bhikkhus, is right speech? Abstinence from false speech, abstinence
from divisive sppech, abstinence from harsh speech, abstinence from idle
chatter: this, bhikkhus, is called right speech.

And what, bhikkhus, is right action? Abstinence from the destruction of life,
abstinence from taking what is not given, abstinence from sexual misconduct:
this, bhikkhus, is called right action.

And what, bhikkhus, is right livelihood? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple,
having abandoned a wrong mode of livelihood, earns his living by a right
livelihood: this, bhikkhus, is called right livelihood.

And what, bhikkhus, is right effort? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, for the
nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states; he generates desire, makes an
effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. For the abandoning of
arisen evil unwholesome states; he generates desire, makes an effort, arouses
energy, applies his mind, and strives. For the arising of unarisen wholesome
states; he generates desire, makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind,
and strives. For the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their nondecay,
increase, expansion, and fulfilment by development; he generates desire, makes
an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This, bhikkhus, is
called right effort.

And what, bhikkhus, is right mindfulness? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells
contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, and mindful,
having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world.

He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, ardent, clearly comprehending, and
mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world.

He dwells contemplating mind in mind, ardent, clearly comprehending, and
mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world.

He dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending,
and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the world. This,
bhikkhus, is called right mindfulness.

And what, bhikkhus, is right concentration? Here, bhikkhus, secluded from
sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, accompanied by thought and
examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, a bhikkhu enters and
dwells in the first jhāna.

With the subsiding of thought and examination, with internal confidence and
unification of mind, being without thought and examination, having the rapture
and happiness born of concentration, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna.

With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and
clearly comprehending, he experiences happiness with the body; that which the
noble ones declare: 'He is equanimous, mindul, one who dwells happily', he
enters and dwells in the third jhāna.

With the abandoning of pleasure, with the abandoning of pain, with the previous
passing away of joy and displeasure, which is neither painful nor pleasant and
includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity, he enters and dwells in
the fourth jhāna. This, bhikkhus, is called right concentration.

This, bhikkhus, is called the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.

In this way he dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena ... or else
mindfulness that ‘there are phenomena’ is simply established in him to the
extent necessary for bare knowledge and repeated mindfulness.

And he dwells independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena in terms of the
Four Noble Truths.

## Conclusion

Bhikkhus, if anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in
such a way for seven years, one of two fruits could be expected for him: either
final knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of clinging left,
nonreturning.

Let alone seven years, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four
foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six years ... five years
... four years ... three years ... two years ... one year,
Let alone one year, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four foundations
of mindfulness in such a way for seven months, one of two fruits could be
expected for him: either final knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of
clinging left, nonreturning. Let alone seven months, bhikkhus. If anyone should
develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six months
... five months ... four months ... three months ... two
months ... one month ... half a month, Let alone half a month,
bhikkhus.

If anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way
for seven days, one of two fruits could be expected for him: eitherfinal
knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of clinging left, nonreturning.

'Bhikkhus, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the
surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and
dejection, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbāna,
namely, the four foundations of mindfulness.'

It was with reference to this that it was said. This is what the Blessed One
said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.
