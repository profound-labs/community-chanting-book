\chapter{Introduction}

Thus have I heard.

On one occasion the Blessed One was in the Kuru country where there was a town
of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus.” “Bhante,” the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed
One said this:

“Bhikkhus, this is the one-way path for the purification of beings, for the
surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and
dejection, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbāna,
namely, the four foundations of mindfulness. What are the four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent,
clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in
regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, ardent,
clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in
regard to the world. He dwells contemplating mind in mind, ardent, clearly
comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to
the world. He dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly
comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to
the world.

\chapter{Contemplation of the Body}

\section{Mindfulness of Breathing}

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating\\
the body in the body?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an
empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, straightened his body,
and established mindfulness in front of him.

Just mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.\\
Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’;\\
or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’\\
Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’;\\
or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’\\
He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body’;\\
he trains thus:‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole body.’\\
He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in tranquilising the bodily formation’;\\
he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out tranquilising the bodily formation.’

Just as, bhikkhus, a skilled lathe-worker or his apprentice,\\
when making a long turn, understands: ‘I make a long turn’;\\
or, when making a short turn, understands: ‘I make a short turn’;\\
so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu\\
breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’;\\
or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’\\
Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’;\\
or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’\\
He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body’;\\
he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole body.’\\
He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in tranquilising the bodily formation’;\\
he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out tranquilising the bodily formation.’

Just as though, bhikkhus, there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of

‘This is hill rice, this is red rice, these are beans, these are peas, this is
millet, this is white rice’; so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body

When there is the tranquillity enlightenment factor in him, a bhikkhu
understands: `There is the tranquillity enlightenment factor in me'; or when
there is no tranquillity enlightenment factor in him, he understands: `There is
no tranquillity enlightenment factor in me'; and he also understands how the
unarisen tranquillity enlightenment factor arises, and how the arisen
tranquillity enlightenment factor comes to fulfillment by deveopment.

When there is the concentration enlightenment factor in him, a bhikkhu
understands: `There is the concentration enlightenment factor in me'; or when
there is no concentration enlightenment factor in him, he understands: `There is
no concentration enlightenment factor in me'; and he also understands how the
unarisen concentration enlightenment factor arises, and how the arisen
concentration enlightenment factor comes to fulfillment by deveopment.

When there is the equanimity enlightenment factor in him, a bhikkhu understands:
`There is the equanimity enlightenment factor in me'; or when there is no

enlightenment factor arises, and how the arisen equanimity enlightenment factor
comes to fulfillment by deveopment.

In this way he dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena internally, or he
dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena externally, or he dwells
contemplating phenomena in phenomena both internally and externally. Or else he
dwells contemplating in phenomena its nature of arising, or he dwells
contemplating in phenomena its nature of vanishing, or he dwells contemplating
in phenomena its nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else mindfulness that
‘there are phenomena’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for
bare knowledge and repeated mindfulness.

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena in terms
of the Four Noble Truths.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating phenomena in phenomena in
terms of the Four Noble Truths?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as it really is: `This is suffering. The

leading to the cessation of suffering.'

\section{Suffering}

And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering; ageing
is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair
are suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what
is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the
five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.

And what, bhikkhus, is birth? The birth of beings into the vaious orders of
beings, their coming to birth, precipitation [in a womb], generation, the
manifestation of the aggregates, obtaining the bases for contact -- this is
called birth.

And what, bhikkhus, is ageing? The ageing of beings in the various orders of

\section{The Origin of Suffering}

And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? It is this
craving, which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust,

craving for existence, and craving for non-existence.

Now where, bhikkhus, does that craving when it is arising arise? When settling
where does it settle? That in the world which is pleasant and agreeable -- here
this craving when it is arising arises, here when settling it settles.

a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna. With the subsiding of thought
and examination, with internal confidence and unification of mind, being without
thought and examination, having the rapture and happiness born of concentration,
he enters and dwells in the second jhāna. With the fading away as well of
rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he
experiences happiness with the body; that which the noble ones declare: 'He is
equanimous, mindul, one who dwells happily', he enters and dwells in the third
jhāna. With the abandoning of pleasure, with the abandoning of pain, with the
previous passing away of joy and displeasure, which is neither painful nor
pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity, he enters
and dwells in the fourth jhāna. This, bhikkhus, is called right concentration.

This, bhikkhus, is called the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.

In this way he dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena internally, or he
dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena externally, or he dwells
contemplating phenomena in phenomena both internally and externally. Or else he
dwells contemplating in phenomena its nature of arising, or he dwells
contemplating in phenomena its nature of vanishing, or he dwells contemplating
in phenomena its nature of both arising and vanishing. Or else mindfulness that
‘there are phenomena’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for
bare knowledge and repeated mindfulness.

And he dwells independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena in terms of the
Four Noble Truths.

\chapter{Conclusion}

Bhikkhus, if anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in
such a way for seven years, one of two fruits could be expected for him: either
final knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of clinging left,
nonreturning.

Let alone seven years, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four
foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six years \ldots{} five years
\ldots{} four years \ldots{} three years \ldots{} two years \ldots{} one year,
Let alone one year, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four foundations
of mindfulness in such a way for seven months, one of two fruits could be
expected for him: either final knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of
clinging left, nonreturning. Let alone seven months, bhikkhus. If anyone should
develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six months
\ldots{} five months \ldots{} four months \ldots{} three months \ldots{} two
months \ldots{} one month \ldots{} half a month, Let alone half a month,
bhikkhus.

If anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way
for seven days, one of two fruits could be expected for him: eitherfinal
knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of clinging left, nonreturning.

`Bhikkhus, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the
surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and
dejection, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbāna,
namely, the four foundations of mindfulness.'

It was with reference to this that it was said. This is what the Blessed One
said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.
