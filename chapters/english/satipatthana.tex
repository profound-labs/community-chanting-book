\chapter{Introduction}

Thus have I heard.

On one occasion the Blessed One was in the Kuru country where there was a town
of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus.” “Bhante,” the bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed
One said this:

“Bhikkhus, this is the one-way path for the purification of beings, for the
surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and
dejection, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbāna,
namely, the four foundations of mindfulness. What are the four?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent,
clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in
regard to the world. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, ardent,
clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in
regard to the world. He dwells contemplating mind in mind, ardent, clearly
comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to
the world. He dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly
comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to
the world.

\chapter{Contemplation of the Body}

\section{Mindfulness of Breathing}

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating\\
the body in the body?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an
empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, straightened his body,
and established mindfulness in front of him.

Just mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.\\
Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’;\\
or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’\\
Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’;\\
or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’\\
He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body’;\\
he trains thus:‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole body.’\\
He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in tranquilising the bodily formation’;\\
he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out tranquilising the bodily formation.’

Just as, bhikkhus, a skilled lathe-worker or his apprentice,\\
when making a long turn, understands: ‘I make a long turn’;\\
or, when making a short turn, understands: ‘I make a short turn’;\\
so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu\\
breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’;\\
or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’\\
Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’;\\
or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’\\
He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body’;\\
he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole body.’\\
He trains thus: ‘I will breathe in tranquilising the bodily formation’;\\
he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out tranquilising the bodily formation.’

\section{The Six Sense Bases}

Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena in terms
of the six internal and external sense bases.

And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating phenomena in phenomena in
terms of the six internal and external sense bases?

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands the eye, he understands forms, and he
understands the fetter that arises dependent on both; and he also understands
how the unarisen fetter arises, and how the arisen fetter is abandoned, and how
the abandoned fetter does not arise again in the future.

He understands the ear, he understands sounds, and he understands the fetter
that arises dependent on both; and he also understands how the unarisen fetter
arises, and how the arisen fetter is abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter
does not arise again in the future.

He understands the nose, he understands odours, and he understands the fetter
that arises dependent on both; and he also understands how the unarisen fetter
arises, and how the arisen fetter is abandoned, and how the abandoned fetter
does not arise again in the future.

He understands the tongue, he understands flavours, and he understands the
fetter that arises dependent on both; and he also understands how the unarisen
fetter arises, and how the arisen fetter is abandoned, and how the abandoned
fetter does not arise again in the future.

or for one who has those who do not desire his welfare, his benefit, his
comfort, and his security -- (and then) having meetings, assembly, connection,

And what, bhikkhus, is `separation from what is pleasing is suffering'? Here,
bhikkhus, for one who has desirable, lovely, agreeable forms, sounds, ordours,
tastes, and tactile objects; or, for one who has those who do desire his
welfare, his benefit, his comfort and his security -- mothers, fathers,
brothers, or sisters; friends, companions, or blood relatives -- (and then) not
having meetings, assembly, connection, and mixing with them: this, bhikkhus, is
called `separation from what is pleasing is suffering'?

And what, bhikkhus, is `not to get what one wants is suffeing'? To beings
subject to birth there comes the wish: `Oh, that we were not subject to birth!
That birth would not come to us!' But this is not to be obtained by wishing;
this is `not to get what one wants is suffering.'

To beings subject to ageing there comes the wish: `Oh, that we were not subject

To beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, there comes
the wish: `Oh, that we were not subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair! That sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair would not come to
us!' But this is not to be obtained by wishing; this is `not to get what one
wants is suffering.'

And what, bhikkhus, are the five aggregates subject to clinging that, in brief,
are suffering? They are: the material form aggregate subject to clinging, the
feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to
clinging, the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, the
consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. These are the five aggregates
subject to clinging that, in brief, are suffering.

This, bhikkhus, is called the noble truth of suffering.

\section{Origin}

And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? It is this
craving, which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust,
seeking delight in this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures,
craving for existence, and craving for non-existence.

Now where, bhikkhus, does that craving when it is arising arise? When settling
where does it settle? That in the world which is pleasant and agreeable -- here
this craving when it is arising arises, here when settling it settles.

In the world what is pleasant and agreeable? In the world the eye \ldots{} the
ear \ldots{} the nose \ldots{} the tongue \ldots{} the body \ldots{} the mind is
likeable and pleasing -- here this craving when it is arising arises, here when
settling it settles.

In the world the forms \ldots{} the sounds \ldots{} the ordours \ldots{} the
tastes \ldots{} the tactile objects \ldots{} the mental phenomena is likeable
and pleasing -- here this craving when it is arising arises, here when settling
it settles.

And what, bhikkhus, is right concentration? Here, bhikkhus, secluded from
sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, accompanied by thought and
examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion, a bhikkhu enters and
dwells in the first jhāna.

With the subsiding of thought and examination, with internal confidence and
unification of mind, being without thought and examination, having the rapture
and happiness born of concentration, he enters and dwells in the second jhāna.

With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and
clearly comprehending, he experiences happiness with the body; that which the
noble ones declare: `He is equanimous, mindul, one who dwells happily', he
enters and dwells in the third jhāna.

With the abandoning of pleasure, with the abandoning of pain, with the previous
passing away of joy and displeasure, which is neither painful nor pleasant and
includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity, he enters and dwells in
the fourth jhāna. This, bhikkhus, is called right concentration.

This, bhikkhus, is called the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.

In this way he dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena \ldots{} or else
mindfulness that ‘there are phenomena’ is simply established in him to the
extent necessary for bare knowledge and repeated mindfulness.

And he dwells independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how,
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena in terms of the
Four Noble Truths.

\chapter{Conclusion}

Bhikkhus, if anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in
such a way for seven years, one of two fruits could be expected for him: either
final knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of clinging left,
nonreturning.

Let alone seven years, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four
foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six years \ldots{} five years
\ldots{} four years \ldots{} three years \ldots{} two years \ldots{} one year,
Let alone one year, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four foundations
of mindfulness in such a way for seven months, one of two fruits could be
expected for him: either final knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of
clinging left, nonreturning. Let alone seven months, bhikkhus. If anyone should
develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six months
\ldots{} five months \ldots{} four months \ldots{} three months \ldots{} two
months \ldots{} one month \ldots{} half a month, Let alone half a month,
bhikkhus.

If anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way
for seven days, one of two fruits could be expected for him: eitherfinal
knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of clinging left, nonreturning.

`Bhikkhus, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the
surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the passing away of pain and
dejection, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbāna,
namely, the four foundations of mindfulness.'

It was with reference to this that it was said. This is what the Blessed One
said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.
