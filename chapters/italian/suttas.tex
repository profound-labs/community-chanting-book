\begin{leader}
\soloinstr{Solo introduction}

This is the first teaching of the Tathāgata on attaining to unexcelled,
perfect enlightenment.

Here is the perfect turning of the incomparable wheel of Truth,
inestimable wherever it is expounded in the world.

Disclosed here are the two extremes, and the Middle Way, with the Four Noble
Truths and the purified knowledge and vision pointed out by the Lord of
Dhamma.

Let us chant together this Sutta proclaiming the supreme, independent
enlightenment that is widely renowned as ‘The~Turning of the Wheel of
the Dhamma.’

\end{leader}

Thus have I heard.

Once when the Blessed One was staying in the deer sanctuary at
Isipatana, near Benares, he spoke to the group of five bhikkhus:

‘These two extremes, bhikkhus, should not be followed by one who has
gone forth: sensual indulgence, which is low, coarse, vulgar, ignoble,
and unprofitable; and self-torture, which is painful, ignoble, and
unprofitable.

‘Bhikkhus, by avoiding these two extremes, the Tathāgata has realized
the Middle Way, which gives vision and understanding, which leads to
calm, penetration, enlightenment, to Nibbāna.

‘And what, bhikkhus, is the Middle Way realized by the Tathāgata, which
gives vision and understanding, which leads to calm, penetration,
enlightenment, to Nibbāna?

‘It is just this Noble Eightfold Path, namely:

‘Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right
Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.

‘Truly, bhikkhus, this Middle Way understood by the Tathāgata produces
vision, produces knowledge, and leads to calm, penetration,
enlightenment, to Nibbāna.

‘This, bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of dukkha:

‘Birth is dukkha, ageing is dukkha, death is dukkha, grief,
lamentation, pain, sorrow and despair are dukkha, association with the
disliked is dukkha, separation from the liked is dukkha, not to get what
one wants is dukkha. In brief, clinging to the five khandhas is dukkha.

‘This, bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of the cause of dukkha:

‘The craving which causes rebirth and is bound up with pleasure and
lust, ever seeking fresh delight, now here, now there; namely, craving
for sense pleasure, craving for existence, and craving for annihilation.

‘This, bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of the cessation of dukkha:

‘The complete cessation, giving up, abandonment of that craving,
complete release from that craving, and complete detachment from it.

‘This, bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of the way leading to the cessation
of dukkha:

‘Only this Noble Eightfold Path; namely, Right View, Right Intention,
Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right
Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.

‘With the thought, “This is the Noble Truth of dukkha,” there arose in
me, bhikkhus, vision, knowledge, insight, wisdom, light, concerning
things unknown before.

Thus in a moment, an instant, a flash, word of the Setting in Motion of
the Wheel of Dhamma went forth up to the Brahma world, and the
ten-thousandfold universal system trembled and quaked and shook, and a
boundless, sublime radiance surpassing the power of devas appeared on
earth.

Then the Blessed One made the utterance,

‘Truly, Koṇḍañña has understood, Koṇḍañña has understood!’ Thus it was
that the Venerable Koṇḍañña got the name Aññā-Koṇḍañña: ‘Koṇḍañña Who
Understands.’

Thus ends the discourse on Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma.

\begin{leader}
\soloinstr{Solo introduction}

All beings should take pains to understand the characteristic of
not-self, which provides matchless deliverance from self-view and
self-perception, as taught by the supreme Buddha.

This teaching is given so that those who meditate on experienceable
realities may arrive at perfect comprehension;

It is for the development of perfect understanding of these phenomena,
and for the investigation of all defiled mind-moments.

The consequence of this practice is total deliverance, so, desirous of
bringing this teaching forth with its great benefit, let us now recite
this Sutta.

\end{leader}

Thus have I heard.

At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Benares in the deer park.
There he addressed the group of five bhikkhus:

‘Form, bhikkhus, is not-self. If, bhikkhus, form were self, then form
would not lead to affliction, and one might be able to say in regard to
form, “Let my form be thus, let my form not be thus.” But since,
bhikkhus, form is not-self, form therefore leads to affliction, and one
is not able to say in regard to form, “Let my form be thus, let my form
not be thus.”

‘Feeling is not-self. If, bhikkhus, feeling were self, feeling would
not lead to affliction, and one might be able to say in regard to
feeling, “Let my feeling be thus, let my feeling not be thus.” But
since, bhikkhus, feeling is not-self, feeling therefore leads to
affliction, and one is not able to say in regard to feeling, “Let my
feeling be thus, let my feeling not be thus.”

‘What do you think about this, bhikkhus? Is consciousness permanent or
impermanent?’

‘Impermanent, Venerable Sir.’

‘But is that which is impermanent painful or pleasurable?’

‘Painful, Venerable Sir.’

‘But is it fit to consider that which is impermanent, painful, of a
nature to change, as “This is mine, I am this, this is my self”?’

‘It is not, Venerable Sir.’

‘Wherefore, bhikkhus, whatever form there is, past, future, present,
internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, whether it
is far or near, all form should, by means of right wisdom, be seen as it
really is, thus: “This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.”

external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, whether it is far or

‘Whatever consciousness there is, past, future, present, internal or
external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, whether far or near,
all consciousness should, by means of right wisdom, be seen as it really
is, thus: “This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.”

‘Seeing in this way, bhikkhus, the wise noble disciple becomes
disenchanted with form, becomes disenchanted with feeling, becomes
disenchanted with perception, becomes disenchanted with mental
formations, becomes disenchanted with consciousness. Becoming
disenchanted, their passions fade away; with the fading of passion the
heart is liberated; with liberation there comes the knowledge: “It is
liberated,” and they know: “Destroyed is birth, the Holy Life has been
lived out, done is what had to be done, there is no more coming into any
state of being.”\thinspace ’

Thus spoke the Blessed One. Delighted, the group of five bhikkhus
rejoiced in what the Blessed One had said. Moreover, while this discourse was
being delivered, the minds of the five bhikkhus were freed from the
defilements, through clinging no more.

Thus ends the discourse on The Characteristic of Not-self.

\soloinstr{Solo introduction}

With his skill in training the trainable, the All-transcendent Buddha,
lucid speaker, teacher of the highest knowledge,

He who expounds to the people the Dhamma and Vinaya that is fitting and
worthy, teaching with this wonderful parable about fire, meditators of
the highest skill;

He has liberated those who listen with the liberation that is utterly
complete, through true investigation, with wisdom\\ and attention.

Let us now recite this Sutta which describes the characteristics\\ of dukkha.

\end{leader}

Thus have I heard.

At one time the Blessed One was staying near Gayā at Gayā Head together
with a thousand bhikkhus. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus:

‘Bhikkhus, everything is burning. And what, bhikkhus, is everything
that is burning?

‘The eye, bhikkhus, is burning, forms are burning, eye consciousness is
burning, eye contact is burning, the feeling that arises from eye
contact, whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is
burning. With what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the
fires of passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth,
ageing, and death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

\enlargethispage{2\baselineskip}

‘The ear is burning, sounds are burning, ear consciousness is burning,
ear contact is burning, the feeling that arises from ear contact,
whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is burning. With
what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the fires of
passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth, ageing, and
death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

‘The nose is burning, odours are burning, nose consciousness is burning,
nose contact is burning, the feeling that arises from nose contact,
whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is burning. With
what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the fires of
passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth, ageing, and
death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

‘The tongue is burning, tastes are burning, tongue consciousness is
burning, tongue contact is burning, the feeling that arises from tongue
contact, whether it is pleasant, painful, or neutral, that too is
burning. With what is it burning? I declare that it is burning with the
fires of passion, hatred, and delusion; it is burning with birth,
ageing, and death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.

‘The body is burning, tangible objects are burning, body consciousness
is burning, body contact is burning, the feeling that arises from body

‘Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the wise noble disciple becomes disenchanted
with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with eye
consciousness, disenchanted with eye contact, and the feeling that
arises from eye contact --- whether it is pleasant, painful, or
neutral --- that too they become disenchanted with.
